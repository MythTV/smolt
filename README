Introduction.

The Fedora hardware profiler is a server-client system that does a hardware
scan against a machine and sends those results to a server so the Fedora
Project server.  The sends are anonymous and should not contain any private
information other than the physical hardware information and basic OS info

Smoon: Smolt Satellite Server, for private inventory

The server is a turbogears instance.  It and the client could very easily be
modified to be used as an inventory system for an enterprise environment.
Anyone interested in doing this please contact me.


Client

The client portion uses the RHN client to create a hardware object that then
gets sent to the server.
