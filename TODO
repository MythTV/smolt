Client:
The client for smolt could use some work.

    * Send PCI / USB Id's instead of the description (Highest priority)
    * Xen / VM flag (am I a guest?)
    * Fix the sending mechanism (currently one send per host and per device)
    * Gui (abadger1999 has proof of concept)
    * Error checking (seriously) 
    * Proper timeout
    * Remove redhat-lsb requirement
    * smoltRemoveProfile
    * smoltDiff

Server:
    * Self removal from the database (Note, I'm not worried about people
           removing other people's hardware.  There's 3.4 * 10 ^ 38
           possible combinations...  That means 1 trillion UUIDs have to be
           created every nanosecond for 10 billion years to exhaust the
           number of UUIDs....  - Wikipedia)
    * Abuse detection / prevention / reparing
    * Built-in RRD graphs (instead of relying on cacti)
    * smoltRemoveProfile
    * Device Stats Page
    * Delete UUID
    * Show UUID
Firstboot:
    * Make the screen make sense
    * Some sort of progress bar during sending?
