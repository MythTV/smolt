Client:
The client for smolt could use some work.

    * Send PCI / USB Id's instead of the description
    * Xen / VM flag (am I a guest?)
    * Proper command flags (--server=, --printOnly (instead of a
    * different smoltPrint), etc)
    * Fix the sending mechanism (currently one send per host and per device)
    * Gui (abadger1999 has proof of concept)
    * Error checking (seriously)
