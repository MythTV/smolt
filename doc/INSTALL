To submit your profile just run "/usr/bin/smoltSendProfile".

To set up the server, please use the files in /database

First set up your user access control for the DB correctly.
As a super user, create a database, 'smoon' for example.
First run sql_create.sql inside your mysql database
This is good enough for the stable version.
Should you want to run the unstable version, you must then
run sql_changs.sql as well.  This will bring your database
up to date.
If you were given a sample dataset, please run this before you run
sql_changs.sql. sql_changes.sql will provide sane defaults for the
data that does not have them.
