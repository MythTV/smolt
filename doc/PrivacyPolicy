Smolt's intention is to send only hardware and basic OS information to the
Fedora smolt server (smoon).  The only tie from the database to a submitters
machine is the UUID.  As long as the submitter does not give out this UUID
the submission should be considered anonymous.  If at any point in time a user
wants to delete their profile from the database they need only run

    smoltDeleteProfile

The information sent to the smolt database server should be considered public
in that anyone can come in and view the statistics and share machine
profiles.  In many ways smolt is designed to get hardware vendors and other
3rd parties attention.  As such, not only will this information be shared with
3rd parties, we will be using smolt as a lever to gain better support for open
source drivers and better support in general.

IP Logging.  In Fedora's smolt install all web traffic goes through a proxy
server first.  This is the only place IP addresses are being logged and they
are kept on that server for a period of 4 weeks at which time log rotation
removes these logs.  The Fedora Project does not aggrigate ip addresses in
the smolt database.  These logs are private and will not be available to the
general public.

Users unhappy with this policy should simply not use smolt.  Users with
questions about this policy should contact the Fedora Infrastructure Team at
admin [at] fedoraproject.org  Also remember that users can delete their
profiles at any time using "smoltDeleteProfile"
